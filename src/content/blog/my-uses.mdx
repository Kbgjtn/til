## Uses

I want to share about the specific software or hardware I use. This is not a static page, it is a living document with everything I am currently using. I use my room as a work from home space where I can complete most of my coursework or other projects.


> **_'If a Cluttered Desk Is a Sign of a Cluttered Mind, We Can‚Äôt Help Wondering What an Empty Desk Indicates'_** - can't find a solid citation

You may or may not agree with the above, but I've always thought about it and thought about it, because I'm not one to clean my desk or other equipment every day, even though I would use it. LOLLL! üòÅ
