## Uses

Ah, right, so let me tell you about the setup I've got here. It’s not some fancy, static page, no, it's more like a living, breathing document of all the gear I’m using at the moment. You know, my little corner where I do most of my coursework, projects, all that jazz. It's like a blend of organised chaos. 🤷‍♂️

And then there's that quote, _"If a Cluttered Desk Is a Sign of a Cluttered Mind, We Can’t Help Wondering What an Empty Desk Indicates"_ -sounds deep, right? I can’t find a solid citation for it, but it gets me thinking. Me? I’m not the type to clean my desk every day (who’s got time for that?), but I always use the stuff, so it’s basically like living in a working mess. You know, that slightly organised chaos that keeps me ticking.

Not that I’m trying to be a slob or anything, it’s just… I’ve always thought about this. Why clean when the mess fuels my productivity? Or maybe it just fuels my laziness. 😂 But hey, I can always pretend it’s my creative process at work, right?
