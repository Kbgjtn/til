**Daniel Ledisnky**, translated and wrote a poem of Hafiz the 14th great century Persian poet and the poem is called "With That Moon Language".

```
Admit something:

... Everyone you see, you say to them, "Love me!".

Of course you do not do this out loud,
otherwise someone would call the cops.

Still, though, think about this, this great pull in us to connect.

Why not become the one who lives with
a full moon in each eye that is always saying,

With that sweet moon language,

what every other eye
in this world is
dying to
hear?

- By Hafiz
```

Most of us forgotten this **universal wish to be loved**, that is beating in our hearts at time, in fact at this moment you reading this sentences.

Do you see in my eyes the wish to be loved?
It is there.

Can you see it in your own eyes?

Why we have forgotten?
Cause it has not worked out,

We have been there before,

We have been hurt by something that we wish,

We have reached so many times,

We reached out to people,

intimate people more distant people.

To be loved, just as we are,
and that did not work.

So instead, we kind of had to forget it,
cause if we continued to seek to be loved in every interaction conciously,
we would be wounded, over and over again. So...
We actually sort of pretend to specialize ourselves,

Oh...
I'll be like **Strong**, **Charming**, **magnetic**, this..., that...

whatsoever, in order to be loved, we are not open for this all the time right?
But still we wish it, every damn time.

Let me tell you, in case you have forgotten, ya

It is a shame, why though?
how is this have to do with shame?

you must know what shame right?
It is a self concious emotion with negative self-evaluation,
so it is mean, **"I'm imagining in my mind what you are imagining and concerning about me and it is
something shit about me."**

That's mental, right?
What did we do? we avoiding it, ofc!

It is fine actually, that is in the rawest form of an innocent emotion that calls for kindness.
we belief that something is wrong with us that render us, unlovable, unworthy, to flawed to be accapted as just we are that is shame..

And when deeply look at the nature of shame we can see that we would never feel shame
if we did not wish to be loved.
